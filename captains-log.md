### Mission: Persistent Ollama Analysis Failure

**Objective:** Resolve the recurring `404 Client Error` during Ollama-powered analysis.

**Mission Summary:**

After successfully resolving frontend-to-backend communication:

1.  **Proxypass Correction:** The "HTTP error!" on the frontend was resolved by identifying a trailing slash issue in `frontend/nginx.conf` (`proxy_pass http://backend:5000/`) which was stripping the `/api` prefix. The `nginx.conf` was modified to `proxy_pass http://backend:5000;`, the frontend image rebuilt, and the frontend deployment restarted.
2.  **Ollama Analysis Still Failing:** Despite previous fixes and increased memory, the backend continued to receive a `404 Client Error` from Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint. This happened even though direct `curl` requests from a debug pod to Ollama were successful (when `stream: true`).
3.  **Dockerfile Build Context Issue (Initial Attempt):** Investigation revealed that the `ollama_analyzer.py` file within the *running* backend pod was consistently an outdated version, still containing `"stream": False`. This indicated a persistent problem with the Docker image build process not incorporating the latest code changes. The `backend/Dockerfile` was modified to reorder and simplify `COPY` commands (`COPY backend/app.py backend/app.py`, `COPY src src`, and `WORKDIR /app`). This aimed to ensure the latest `src` directory was correctly copied and not overwritten by stale content.
4.  **`stream: True` Correction:** The `ollama_analyzer.py` file was updated to include `"stream": True` in the JSON payload sent to Ollama.
5.  **Persistent Outdated File:** Despite `--no-cache` in Cloud Build and multiple rebuilds/redeployments, the `ollama_analyzer.py` in the running backend pod remained outdated. This indicated a deeper issue with the Cloud Build context not picking up local file changes.
6.  **Backend Directory Restructuring (Workaround):** To force Cloud Build to pick up the latest `src` directory, the `backend` directory was temporarily restructured:
    *   The original `backend` directory was renamed to `backend_old`.
    *   A new `backend` directory was created.
    *   `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the entire `src` directory (containing the updated `ollama_analyzer.py`) were copied into the *new* `backend` directory.
    *   The `backend/Dockerfile` was updated to use `COPY . .` and `CMD ["python3", "app.py"]` to reflect this new structure.
7.  **Rebuild and Redeploy (after restructuring):** The backend image was rebuilt via Cloud Build and redeployed to Kubernetes.
8.  **API Call Issues:** Attempts to trigger the `/api/scrape` endpoint via the Ingress resulted in:
    *   `411 Length Required` (resolved by adding `Content-Type: application/json` and an empty JSON body).
    *   `502 Server Error` (likely due to the backend pod not being fully ready after redeployment).

**Current Blocker:** The backend is returning a `502 Server Error` after redeployment, and the Ollama analysis is still failing with `404 Client Error` (as seen in previous backend logs, though not yet confirmed with the latest deployment). The "unexpected token error" was also reported by the user, which needs investigation.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Verify Backend Readiness:** Wait for the backend pod to be fully ready after the latest redeployment.
2.  **Trigger Scrape and Check Logs:** Trigger the `/api/scrape` endpoint again via `curl` and immediately check the backend pod logs for successful Ollama analysis and the absence of the `404 Client Error` or any new errors (like the "unexpected token error").
3.  **Revert Temporary Changes:** Once the issue is resolved, revert the temporary changes made to the `backend` directory structure (rename `backend` back to `backend_old`, delete the new `backend` directory, and restore the original `backend` directory).

### Mission: Persistent Ollama Analysis Failure (Continued)

**Objective:** Resolve the recurring `404 Client Error` during Ollama-powered analysis.

**Mission Summary:**

The debugging session continued, focusing on the persistent `404 Client Error` from the Ollama service. The following steps were taken:

1.  **Directory Restructuring and Build Process:** The temporary directory restructuring was reverted, and the `backend/Dockerfile` and `cloudbuild.yaml` were corrected to use the appropriate build context and file paths. The `ollama` and `kubernetes` Python libraries were also added to the `backend/requirements.txt` file.
2.  **Deployment Issues:** After the corrections, the backend deployment continued to fail with the error `python3: can't open file '/app/app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`. This was eventually resolved by correcting the `COPY` commands in the `backend/Dockerfile` and the build context in `cloudbuild.yaml`.
3.  **Ollama Deployment:** It was discovered that the Ollama deployment was missing from the cluster. The deployment was recreated using the `kubernetes/ollama-deployment-updated.yaml` manifest.
4.  **Persistent 404 Error:** Despite all the corrections and the successful deployment of both the backend and Ollama, the `404 Client Error` persists when the backend attempts to communicate with the Ollama service. The error occurs even when using the direct IP address of the Ollama service, and after adding a `sleep` to the analyzer to rule out race conditions.

**Current Blocker:** The backend pod is unable to resolve or connect to the Ollama service, resulting in a `404 Client Error`. This is happening despite the debug pod being able to connect to the service successfully.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Network Policy Investigation:** The next logical step is to investigate if a network policy is preventing the backend pod from communicating with the Ollama pod. I will check for any network policies in the `default` and `ollama` namespaces.
2.  **Frontend Error:** The "unexpected token error" reported by the user still needs to be investigated once the backend is stable.

### Mission: Persistent Ollama Analysis Failure (Continued)

**Objective:** Resolve the recurring `404 Client Error` during Ollama-powered analysis.

**Mission Summary:**

1.  **Network Policy Investigation:** Checked for network policies in both the `default` and `ollama` namespaces, but none were found. This ruled out network policies as the cause of the issue.
2.  **Code Update Verification:** Discovered that the backend code was not being updated in the running pods, which explained why previous fixes were not taking effect. This was resolved by correcting the build and deployment process.
3.  **NameError Resolution:** After the code was successfully updated, two new errors appeared: `NameError: name 'logging' is not defined` and `NameError: name 'subprocess' is not defined`. These were resolved by adding the corresponding import statements to `src/analysis/ollama_analyzer.py`.
4.  **Ollama Log Analysis:** Checked the logs of the Ollama service and confirmed that it is receiving the requests from the backend, but it is responding with a `404 Not Found` error.
5.  **Final Debugging Stalemate:** Despite all efforts, the `404 Client Error` persists. The root cause remains elusive, as `curl` from a debug pod to the Ollama service is successful, while the `requests` library in the backend receives a 404.

**Current Blocker:** The backend pod is unable to successfully connect to the Ollama service. All attempts to debug the issue have been exhausted.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Seek User Assistance:** The issue has been escalated to the user for further investigation. It has been suggested that the user attempt to reproduce the issue locally and to double-check the versions of all relevant libraries and dependencies.
